            Adblock detect gives you information weather user is using adblock or not.
            This is done via simple javascript check - no fake network requests or iframes are created,
            everything is done with one little bait element that ad blocker extensions like to bite on.
            Once you know if ad blocker is active or not you might render some message or alter page layout
             in some way - no assumptions are made on our side.
